        <p>Due to the immense popularity of game controllers, a new design series was needed, therefore the Sega Genesis was created. Produced by Sega under supervision by Hideki Sato and Masami Ishikawa in 1988, it was extremely different from the previous controller series, being more like a semi circle in shape rather than a rectangle. This smooth, erganomic design made it much more comfortable for playing games over longer periods of time. The design was such that it fit the hand shape much better, the buttons and stick-controller was placed on the sides, making it a much better, user-friendly design.</p>
        <p>713 games were made for the Sega Genesis, including by far the most popular game; Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic the Hedgehog was released in 1991 and has become so popular over the years, it now has a count of 90 stand alone games! Another trendy game which gained much attention was Gunstar Heroes, released in 1993 it was a big hit in the gaming community. Praised for its success mainly due to its frantic action and adanced graphics, it alone helped to establish game designer Treasure in 1993 and introduced many game conventions which are now characteristic of other games today.</p>
