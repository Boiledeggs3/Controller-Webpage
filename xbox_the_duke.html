        <h3>Xbox "The Duke"</h3>

        <p>This controller was made in 2001, designed by Seamus Blackley, and is the bulkiest controller yet. It is likened to the controller series' before it; the Playstation's Dualshock and Gamecube, this is because of the two off-set joysticks. Blackley placed the buttons, A, B, X and Y, which are colour coordinated, above the joystick. Although it is the bulkiest controller out, it was still the best available and appealed to the young generation it was designed for with its large green X button in central location. It was the last in the Xbox series to be wired.</p>
        <p>The most defining feature of the the Duke was the LCD screen located in the middle of it, which, when turned on, played the original Xbox boot-up animation. It could replay the animation when pressed because it was also a button.</p>
        <p>The 'Duke' part of the name came from Brett Schnepf, the project manager of Microsoft during the Xbox's development, who's son was named Duke.</p>
        <p>The reason why the Duke was so bulky was because Microsoft had asked their supplier, Mitsumi Electric, for a similar folded and stacked circuit board design used in Sony's DualShock 2 controller, but the company refused to manufacture such a design for Microsoft. This led to the controller being bulky and nearly three times the size of Sony's creation.</p>
